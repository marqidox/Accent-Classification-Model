# Accent-Classification-Model
Created a categorical cross-entropy model using the Python libraries Keras, Scikit-Learn, and Tensorflow to categorize the accent of an input voice recording file as Spanish or English
Resulted in a model accuracy of 87% through artificial augmentation of audio data and iteration of different model hyperparameters
Increased my understanding of the effect quantity and diversity of data has on accent recognition models
